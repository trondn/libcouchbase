NAME
----
lcb_evict - Force an eviction of a document from the in-memory database cache

SYNOPSIS
--------
cc [ flag ... ] file... -lcouchbase [ library ... ]

    #include <libcouchbase/couchbase.h>

    lcb_error_t lcb_evict(lcb_t instance,
                          const void *command_cookie,
                          lcb_size_t num,
                          const lcb_evict_cmd_t *const *commands);

DESCRIPTION
-----------
lcb_evict() is used to force the eviction of a document from the
clusters memory (which would force the cluster to page the item
back in from persistent storage if anyone tries to access it again).
If the library instance is using asynchronous mode (the default) this
operation will return immediately and schedule the operations to be
executed by the event loop, otherwise it will block until all commands
are executed. command_cookie is is an opaque field that will be
provided to the callback function. num is the number of entries in the
commands array.

lcb_evict_cmd_t is a structure defined in <libcouchbase/arguments.h>:

    typedef struct {
        int version;              /* The entry in "v" to use */
        union {
            struct {
                const void *key;    /* The key this response belongs to */
                lcb_size_t nkey;    /* The number of bytes in the key */
                lcb_cas_t cas;      /* To specify the version to evict */
                const void *hashkey; /* hash key if != key */
                lcb_size_t nhashkey; /* number of bytes in hash key */
            } v0;
        } v;
    } lcb_get_cmd_t;


key and nkey is used to specify the key to evict from the server. To
specify a given version of the key the cas value for the key may be
specified to a non-null value. hashkey and nhashkey may be used to
determine which server the key is supposed to be located.

Upon completion the evict callback as set by lcb_set_evict_callback is
called.

RETURN VALUES
-------------
lcb_evict() returns the LCB_SUCCESS on success, or a specific error code
upon failure. See lcb_strerror(3couchbase) for more information.

The normal codes which could be passed to the evict callback are:

|=================================================================
| LCB_SUCCESS     | The operation completed successfully and the key was evicted from memory
| LCB_KEY_EEXISTS | The key cannot be ejected, because the object is dirty or too small
| LCB_KEY_ENOENT  | The given key cannot be found in the database
|=================================================================


EXAMPLES
--------

    #include <libcouchbase/couchbase.h>

    ...
    lcb_t instance;
    ...
    lcb_evict_cmd_t *evict = calloc(1, sizeof(*evict));
    evict->version = 0;
    evict->v.v0.key = "my-key";
    evict->v.v0.nkey = strlen(evict->v.v0.key);
    lcb_evict_cmd_st* commands[] = { evict };
    lcb_evict(instance, NULL, 1, commands);
    ...
